ðŸ“Š IBM Sales Prediction :

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

The IBM Sales Prediction project aims to predict sales using machine learning models.
Sales forecasting helps businesses make informed decisions on inventory, production, and strategy.
By analyzing historical data and applying predictive models, this project provides insights into future sales trends.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives

Analyze and clean the IBM sales dataset.
Explore data patterns and relationships.
Build and evaluate predictive models for sales forecasting.
Visualize results and provide insights.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset

Source: IBM sample dataset (sales data).
Features: Product details, customer attributes, transaction data, and sales values.
Target: Predicted sales amount.

ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow

Data Collection â€“ Importing dataset into Google Colab.
Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualizing patterns, correlations, and trends.
Model Building â€“ Training models like:

Decision Tree Regressor ,
Random Forest Regressor ,
Model Evaluation â€“ Using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
Prediction & Visualization â€“ Predicting future sales and plotting results.
